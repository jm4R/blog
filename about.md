Hello!
My name is Mariusz Jaskółka. I live near Kraków (Cracow), Poland. C++ is both my job and passion. I like to share my knowledge about it which led me to start writing articles to Polish blog [cpp-polska.pl](https://cpp-polska.pl/). To make my texts able to reach a wider and more international public I have decided to translate it into English. I do not pretend to know everything about programming but I believe there is knowledge that I can share with you as well as receive your feedback in comments.

PS: My English might not be perfect, so mistakes can happen. Feel free to contact me if you find any significant mistake or with any other concern.
