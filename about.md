Hello!
My name is Mariusz Jaskółka. C++ is both my job and passion. From time to time I write an article about modern C++ in polish blog [cpp-polska.pl](https://cpp-polska.pl/). I have decided to translate it into english, so that my articles could reach a wider and more international public. My english might not be perfect, so mistakes can happen. Feel free to contact me if you find any significant mistake or with any other concern.
